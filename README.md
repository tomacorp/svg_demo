# svg_demo

Simple demonstration of using Snap.svg library in a test environment

SVG + Javascript + CSS + Python

This was created to make a minimal example for making a web page with CSS that also uses Snap.

A small python web server is also included.
This project can be tested without Python, though. 
Just point a web browser at the file eyes_example.html.

This repo can be installed with bower.
